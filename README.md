<h1>Restaurant Reviews App: Stage 3</h1>
This is the third and final stage of the three stage course material project <b>Restaurant Reviews</b>.

Building upon the responsive and accessible design that was developed in the first stage, the app should now connect to an external server
to retrieve JSON data. The preparation to start working on this project and implement the requirements documented below, included:

 
<h2>Project Requirements</h2>
 
 - **Responsive Design:** The application maintains a responsive design on mobile, tablet and desktop viewports. All new features are responsive, including the form to add a review and the control for marking a restaurant as a favorite.

 - **Accessibility:** The application retains accessibility features from the previous projects. Images have alternate text, the application uses appropriate focus management for navigation, and semantic elements and ARIA attributes are used correctly. Roles are correctly defined for all elements of the review form. Modal or interstitial windows appropriately lock focus.

 - **Meet Performance Requirements:** Optimize the site to ensure that the following performance benchmarks are satisfied (measure performance using the Lighthouse):
 
   - **Progressive Web App** score should be at **90 or better**.
   - **Performance** score should be at **90 or better**.
   - **Accessibility** score should be at **90 or better**.
