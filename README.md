<h2>Branches</h2>
This repository is split into the following branches based on the app's phase of development.

 - [**restaurant_reviews-stage_1**](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/restaurant/tree/restaurant_reviews-stage_1)**:** Building upon the provided restaurant reviews website, converts the existing static design into a fully responsive design that renders appropriately in any viewport including desktop, tablet, and mobile displays. Additionally, implements all standard accessibility features that are currently missing with the use of semantic markup and ARIA atributes. Finally, starts converting this website to a Progressive Web Application by caching some assets for offline use.
